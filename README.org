#+TITLE: pipenv sample usage

If you develop applications in Python,
[[https://docs.pipenv.org/][pipenv]] is a very useful tool.

Tools with similar goals include pip-tools and poetry.

It is not a replacement for pip and virtualenv,
but an excellent wrapper that makes common project-based dependency management dead-simple.

This repository contains a very simple example I recently
used to explain some of the advantages.

Of particular use may be the Dockerfile, which creates a fairly minimal image for you

* Future Improvements

- Document the advantages of pipenv on display here
- Short screencast?
- Make an ONBUILD version of the Dockerfile and push to hub.docker.com
